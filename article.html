      The Environmental Crisis is urging us to think both
      in borderless and decolonized worlds. Confronting the
      idea of nation-based territorial sovereignty and claiming
      an end to neocolonial hypocrisy, the environmental crisis
      evidences the extreme interrelationality of territories and
      communties and demands us to re-think and question
      the inherited colonial hierarchies still present today.

      In the neoliberal world we live in, the infrastructures and
      technologies that surround us have become so deeply adapted
      to our lifestyles to the point of appearing as ubiquitous - as
      frameworks in which we cannot distinguish the apparatus behind
      them, not only in a technical level but also the models they
      pursue and sustain. At the same time, the co-dependence within
      ecosystems, a basic concept of biology we often forget, together
      with the global market of importation and exportation of
      non-renewable resources (especially by Global North in the Global
      South) question the ethical criteria upon which countries are
      measured with and put into evidence who is dominating the
      discourse in the struggle against the environmental crisis.

      It is important that the care for the territory is not confused
      with the care for the nation, on the contrary it is the care
      for the trans-nation, the common territory we share as world.
      It is until we embrace an interrelational and borderless notion
      of the territory, that we can get rid of the modern values which
      perpetuate the notion of nature as solely a resource to extract
      which is aligned with human extinction.

      In the Northern part of the South American continent, next to the
      Caribbean Sea, stands the Guajira Peninsula, an extensive desert
      which is home to the largest aboriginal community of both Colombia
      and Venezuela. Originally a nomadic tribe which migrated 3,000 years
      ago from the Amazon Rainforest and Antilles to the desert, the Wayuu
      have been preserving this territory as a borderless and communitary
      space, its territory as a living being with memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the Wayuus cosmovision, the world was created through the
      romance between the Rain and the Earth; to make the Earth content,
      the Rain sang, and as its sang Thunder Lightnings allowed life to
      emerge. First the Flora, then the Fauna, finally Humans.
    </p>

      Despite this myth, since 2010 there has not been a single raindrop,
      for which in 2014 it was declared territory in calamity. “The Macuira,
      our territory is not good for walking anymore, nor growing crops or
      nourishing our animals. We are all thirsty and slowly malnourished. We
      are burning.”(1) Said a member of the Wayuu community. Its extreme
      marginalization and its constant and historical abandonment by the
      state, have resulted in severe problems with the incursion of illegal
      groups, armed conflict and gender violence. Along with this, a lack of
      access to health services, basic sanitation and most crucial, a lack of
      drinking water that has caused death to more than 5000 people in the
      last seven years.

      In the midst of these conditions, El Cerrejón - one of the largest
      open coal mines in the world began. Being in construction through
      out three phases from 1976 to 2010 (the same year since the last
      raindrop in Guajira), Cerrejón was both a promise for employment
      and a tool to bring attention to the zone. Nevertheless, it turned
      out to become one of the main sources of problems for the region
      and the community. Being completely owned by foreigners, 98% of
      the Cerrejón supply is exported and only 10% of the total sales
      remains as profit for the state.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further from a disproportionate economic relation, Cerrejón has had
      severe implications for the local Wayuu communities depriving them
      from basic needs and prioritizing its economical ambitions over life
      of the community. Cerrejón has caused numerous cases of involuntary
      resettlement of the community affecting their traditional lifestyle
      and subjugating them to conditions imposed by the Cerrejón.
      Furthermore, through inadequate consultation processes, its deep
      excavation and mining has caused severely unhealthy air pollution, the
      air is full of particles of coal which have already affected genetically
      newborn babies and also the balance of the aquifers in all the zone.
      Cerrejón has also been involved in the corruption of the zone and some
      sources affirm it has financed illegal military groups. “During this
      country-wide conflict the communities in the mining regions Cesar and
      in La Guajira suffered greatly. The role of mining companies during
      this period is subject of controversial allegations related to
      displacement and collaboration with paramilitary.” (2)

      Since 2016 until 2019 there has been an approved plan to divert
      the Bruno stream 720 meters from its original riverbed throughout
      3,6 km. The Bruno Stream is part of the main affluent, the Rancheria
      river, the main source of water to The Guajira, a desert which is
      dependant on this river. Diverting the stream is a first step to
      dry the river in order to extract coal from beneath the river. In
      2019, after alerts from the community and deeper research developed
      by the Universidad Nacional, the Constitutional Court sewed the
      company for taking the basic rights from the community but the process
      was almost complete, the stream is already affected. This macabre plan
      has taken the life of several Wayuus and it has affected the health of
      many by stealing their food and water sovereignty.

      In between the abundant Spree river and the Köpenicker Straße in
      Berlin, stands the Heizkraftwerk, a combined heat and power plant in
      Mitte, a district of Berlin. The power plant belongs to the Swedish
      energy group Vattenfall Europe Wärme, which belongs to a German sub-group,
      responsible for the operation. Vattenfall is the electric utility for the
      states of Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, Berlin,
      Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Saxony in Germany. Being the sixth largest
      consumer of energy in the world, Germany imports more than half of its
      energy. Yet, it has been called "the world's first major renewable energy
      economy" 3 and has a reputation for its low carbon emissions. Nevertheless,
      “Vattenfall has taken the commercial decision to do business in Colombia.
      Colombian coal is attractive for Vattenfall both from a commercial and
      technical perspective and enables us to maintain a diversified sourcing
      portfolio” (4) admits the company in its official page when manifesting
      its position towards the situation in Cerrejón.

      In the land where Thunder Lights created life, there is not even water
      anymore. All this energy is now in Germany
